tThe CarboDebt program is a smart contract framework for traking  emission responsabilities associated with the consumption of hydrocarbon resources. It is not a carbon credit program, it is a debt contract that holds no explicit value. However, it does measure the responability retained by the holder with respect to the hydrocarbon resources that they produce or consume.

We summarize the function of the carbo-debt contract in the 5 points below.

anyone can create a carbo debt wallet to issue carbon budget attributed to production/ownership of commodity with a known energy content/intput 
Each participant in a contract is defined by a given decentralized identifier (DiD)
 supplier (hydrocarbon producers). Usually the first creators of carbon debt
transformer (refiners)
distributer (trading companies, bunkers, ...) 
consumer (can voluntarily create debt contract if not initiated further upstream)
carbon management/removal (sequestration, reforestation, ,,,)
managers also play the role of converting Carbon debt into carbon gold ...=
 Can request to send carbo debt to a counter-party, with the receiving parties approval (signature)
The debt contract is transferred on sale of commodity, 
paying manager to offload the responsability
Contract participants can fund contract 
 pay owner to retain debt
incentivize carbon manager to off-take the debt
Recipients can decline to receive the deb, contract stipulates the additional charge the debt owner will charge for retaining debt 



There are two strategies for implementing carbo-debt;
    1. a trustless and voluntary carbon management game (more complex network dynamics, easier institutional framework)
    2. a trusted/permissioned binding contract  (less complicated network design, more challenging institutional design). 


Trustless game, anonymous voluntary participation. 
    a. A non-binding carbon management game
    b. designed to operate on a permissionless network (e.g. ethereum). More copmlex network dynamics
    c. Anyone can create a wallet to voluntarily issue debt contracts
    d. Wallet owners are free to choose the DID used to represent it in a debt contracts as
    e. Within the game there is no trust held in the the role of each contract participant. They can not be held accountable for their stated role. This are non-binding.Does not guarantee that a contract participant conforms to the DID it has selected
    f. Network scalability becomes a challenge under this design
    g. decentralized but trustless. anyone can create a DID and therefore offload any accumulated debt by owning keys to both a carbon consumers , and management DID. 
    h. Need to establish rules that encourage fair competition. For example most creative strategies for offloading debt

Trusted identity network . Legally accountable contracts.

    a. Operate under a permissioned ID network (e.g. hyperledger Indy) where stewards are selected to issue trusted decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
    b. Only stewards can issue verified DIDs (trusted) 
    c Greater network scalability and efficiency
    d. must establish an independent governance body to ensure fair and decentralized DID registration
    e. easier network to operate, but requires development of multilateral institutions on how to manage trust in carbon debt contracts
    f. fair representation/registration of producers and consumer's  
    g. independent environmental institutions to regulate DID fo carbon managers
    h. Efforts needed to avoid centralization of the trusted DID network
    can be legally binding as there is an element of trust in DID ownership and issuance
    i. Cheating is less of an issue (trust) but must invest in oversight and complex rules to govern the issuance and expiry of DIDs and contract terms.

Also, it does not aim to penalize or blame hydrocarbon or energy inyemsw industries as the problem, but provide a scientifically rigorous account of where emission debt are coming from and where they are going. In essence tracking the source to the consumer, the true source of the problem. Most if not all of these references isolate energy intense industries as the problem, whereas carbon debt is designed to work with these industries to encourage them and the final consumers of their products to track and manage their emission responsibilities more directly.

We do not price this debt, however over time the network is designed to enable producers and consumers to establish a value on their debt. How much am I willing to spend to offload my debt, for example paying companies to reduce CO2 emissions, or how much as a supplier I will charge for retaining the responsibility/debt for commodities I sell to the market. 

This is an inclusive system designed to work with existing energy intense industries and producers.

  p A decentralized accounting application to track carbon from the source though commercial transactions and trade flows.

  p 
    span 
      b Our Mission: 
    span support ESG investment activities for the #[a(href='https://www.kapsarc.org/research/publications/achieving-climate-goals-by-closing-the-loop-in-a-circular-carbon-economy/',target="_blank") Circular Carbon Economy] intiative through transparent carbon accounting and management. Provide an open voluntary platform for interoperable carbon markets.

  h2 Distributed Carbon Accounting 
  p The Saudi Arabian Carbon Accounting Token (SACAT) provides an open accounting ledger where anyone can register a public address to issue and trade (CAT), measured in Kilograms (Kg) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e):
    ul
      li <strong>Potential</strong> carbon from mined hydrocarbon resources, harvested biomass, ...
      li <strong>Embodied</strong> or realized carbon emissions in products and services
      li <strong>Retained</strong> carbon in consumer products (e.g. chemicals, plastics)

  p CATs are idealy issued at the source by hydrocarbon producers, and are voluntarily exchanged as certificates in commercial transactions (post-trade).
  
  h3 CAT Contracts

  p SACAT operates on a public distributed ledger (#[a(href='https://ethereum.org/',target="_blank") Ethereum] Ropsten testnet), not controlled a central authority. Creation and trading of CAT is done through, transparent smart contracts, secured by private keys associated with a user's public address. 

  p Escrow contracts are used to negotiate the exchange of CAT certificates in commercial transactions. Since CATs are an account of carbon associated with the activities of individuals, businesses and other intitutions, they can be generated by anyone with a public address.


  h3 CAT Consortium
  p A dedicated ledger/contract enginge for CAT is targeted for release in Q4 2020. This will replace the current version running on Ethereum, a first step to transition the operation of CAT to a consortium of public and private sector institutions. 
  p The consortium's objective is to coordinate and standardize carbon accounting practices among leading industry players. The consortium is tasked with identifying areas of cooperation between competitiors, to support international commitments to climate change, and position industry players within the low carbon economy.
  p To register and submit transactions on the current prototype (Ethereuem Ropsten testnet) enable your browser to use Ethereum with the #[a(href='https://metamask.io/',target="_blank") Metamask] plugin, and request funds to execute transactions from a #[a(href='https://faucet.ropsten.be/',target="_blank") Ropsten faucet ]

  
  h3 CarboGold
  p Emission offset certificates for the CAT ledger issued by a distirbuted Stamper network.  The process of issuing CarboGold sets the value on managing carbon emissions (potential or realized), directing funds to these efforts, as wel as an audited process to support existing carbon market mechanisms. The transition from CAT to CarboGold is meant to influence behavior, and perceptions on the value of carbon emissions associated with the products and services we consume. Some applications: 
  ul
    li Voluntary offset - negotiate for a fee as an exchange for CAT in a commercial transaction (e.g. flight purchase) 
    li Offset guarantee - purchase and lock up CarbGold to comply with emissions quotaas in an existing market mechanism 
 

  h2 The COG Stamper Network
  p A directory of verified Stampers, or carbon waste managers (e.g. natural resource stewards, active carbon catpure and storage). The network is based the governance principles of the Carbon Offset Group (COG):
    ul
      li Identify potential carbon managers/stamper by nomination 
      li Select offset providers through a democratic voting/oversight protocol
      li Verify carbon managment activities through trusted oracle reporting
      li Prove trade of stamped carbon in commercial transactions and commit (lock) them to individual offset requirements within existing carbon markets. 

  p COG is under devleopment, and will be rolled out as permissioned Decentralized Identity (DID) network. It invovles robust selection and monitoring by reputable public and private institutions; governments, envirnomental monitoring agencies, research institutes, universities, NGOs, and industry participants.  

  h3 CarboGold Circulation
  p Stampers are governed by policies that control the ciculation of CarboGold certificates. This includes the rate at which CAT can be offset, reserve requirements for stamper, and others. Policies apply to the individual DIDs of stamper accounts, that expire and renew on a rolling basis. Before a policy is renewed/activated the stamper's DID must pass through a voting stage to reach consensus on their offset capability and management.

  h3 DID Infrastructure
  p COG will be built using open source code from the #[a(href='/https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy', target="_blank") Hyperledger Indy] blockcahin project, based on the design of the #[a(href='/https://sovrin.org/', target="_blank") Sovrin Network].

There are two strategies for implementing carbo-debt;
    1. a trustless and voluntary carbon management game (more complex network dynamics, easier institutional framework)
    2. a trusted/permissioned binding contract  (less complicated network design, more challenging institutional design). 


Trustless game, anonymous voluntary participation. 
    a. A non-binding carbon management game
    b. designed to operate on a permissionless network (e.g. ethereum). More copmlex network dynamics
    c. Anyone can create a wallet to voluntarily issue debt contracts
    d. Wallet owners are free to choose the DID used to represent it in a debt contracts as
    e. Within the game there is no trust held in the the role of each contract participant. They can not be held accountable for their stated role. This are non-binding.Does not guarantee that a contract participant conforms to the DID it has selected
    f. Network scalability becomes a challenge under this design
    g. decentralized but trustless. anyone can create a DID and therefore offload any accumulated debt by owning keys to both a carbon consumers , and management DID. 
    h. Need to establish rules that encourage fair competition. For example most creative strategies for offloading debt

Trusted identity network . Legally accountable contracts.

    a. Operate under a permissioned ID network (e.g. hyperledger Indy) where stewards are selected to issue trusted decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
    b. Only stewards can issue verified DIDs (trusted) 
    c Greater network scalability and efficiency
    d. must establish an independent governance body to ensure fair and decentralized DID registration
    e. easier network to operate, but requires development of multilateral institutions on how to manage trust in carbon debt contracts
    f. fair representation/registration of producers and consumer's  
    g. independent environmental institutions to regulate DID fo carbon managers
    h. Efforts needed to avoid centralization of the trusted DID network
    can be legally binding as there is an element of trust in DID ownership and issuance
    i. Cheating is less of an issue (trust) but must invest in oversight and complex rules to govern the issuance and expiry of DIDs and contract terms.
